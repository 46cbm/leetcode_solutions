Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, 
both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next 
ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, 
there should be no "holes" between ranks.

+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the 
following report (order by highest score):

SELECT s1.Score, COUNT(DISTINCT s2.Score) AS Rank
FROM Scores s1 JOIN Scores s2
ON s1.Score<=s2.Score
GROUP BY s1.Id
ORDER BY Rank;

+-------+------+
| Score | Rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
|Â 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+


Create table If Not Exists Scores (Id int, Score DECIMAL(3,2));
Truncate table Scores;
insert into Scores (Id, Score) values ('1', '3.5');
insert into Scores (Id, Score) values ('2', '3.65');
insert into Scores (Id, Score) values ('3', '4.0');
insert into Scores (Id, Score) values ('4', '3.85');
insert into Scores (Id, Score) values ('5', '4.0');
insert into Scores (Id, Score) values ('6', '3.65');
