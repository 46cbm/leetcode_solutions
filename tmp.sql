The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. 
Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|Id    |Name 	  |Department |ManagerId |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|101   |John 	  |A 	      |null      |
|102   |Dan 	  |A 	      |101       |
|103   |James 	  |A 	      |101       |
|104   |Amy 	  |A 	      |101       |
|105   |Anne 	  |A 	      |101       |
|106   |Ron 	  |B 	      |101       |

Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out managers
 with at least 5 direct report. For the above table, your SQL query 
 should return:

SELECT 
FROM Employee e JOIN 
(
SELECT Id
FROM Employee
WHERE ManagerId IS NULL) AS t
ON e.ManagerId=t.Id
GROUP BY e.ManagerId
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT e.Id) >= 5;

SELECT Name
FROM Employee
WHERE Id IN (
SELECT ManagerId
FROM Employee
GROUP BY ManagerId
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT Id)>=5)

| Name  |

| John  |

Note:
No one would report to himself.


Create table If Not Exists Employee (Id int, Name varchar(255), Department varchar(255), ManagerId int);
Truncate table Employee;
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) values ('101', 'John', 'A', NULL);
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) values ('102', 'Dan', 'A', '101');
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) values ('103', 'James', 'A', '101');
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) values ('104', 'Amy', 'A', '101');
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) values ('105', 'Anne', 'A', '101');
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) values ('106', 'Ron', 'B', '101');
